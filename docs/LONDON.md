Implementation paths and commands below belong to the edition repository. This brief retains its source audits and staged delivery history.

**A London motion study**

*London, geographically and otherwise.*

**All Change** is unmistakably London railway language: an instruction, a description of constant interchange, and a slightly ominous title for a glowing city after dark. It also names what is happening technically—the instrument is changing shape as it becomes capable of another place.

London offers a useful inversion of Switzerland: an intensely layered metropolitan network whose identity comes from interchange, radial pressure, orbital lines and the River Thames rather than a national clockface and Alpine geography.

## Current state — 13 September 2026

The inspected checkout and [public release metadata](https://motionstudies.app/allchange/_release.json) both identify `da94953`. The geographic/diagram transition now sits within a much broader London study. The full bus-catalogue artifact is implemented with audited gaps; route 26/N26 is its original corridor milestone, not the current extent. Shared packages are pinned to alpha.9. See the [series status record](STUDY-STATUS.md) for the limits of deployment verification.

| Layer or study | Current retained scope | Evidence boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TfL rail | 11,177 journeys, 508 stops, twelve two-hour chunks for 4 September 2026 | Scheduled interpolation, including recurring timetable sources |
| TfL buses | 103,117 journeys, 19,756 stops, 670 active routes out of 672 advertised, same study day | Audited with gaps; branch-origin issues remain; not observed running |
| London National Rail | 8,362 journeys, eleven service families, 300 active stations and a 4 km fringe | Working timetable/public eNRT reconciliation; London scope, not all Great Britain. The coverage inventory includes one additional closed station |
| International | 55 St Pancras Eurostar calls; 40 supported HS1 movements, fifteen timetable-only services | Unmatched or conflicting London timings stay explicit |
| River / cable | 492 journeys and 26 stops | Scheduled River Bus and cableway interpolation |
| Passenger demand | NUMBAT 2025 typical autumn Friday; 432 validated areas | Entry, exit and interchange estimates, not tracked people or train occupancy |
| Cycle hire | Four separate dates, 28–31 May 2026; Friday has 31,247 included journeys and 792 docks | Recorded dock endpoints and times; straight connections are schematic, not observed street routes |
| Roads | 5 September 2025; 232 reporting detector sites from 304 candidates | Observed aggregate flow/speed, reconstructed streams; missing readings remain gaps |

Combined TfL/National Rail station boards, separate King's Cross/St Pancras rail areas and the Eurostar board are implemented. **After Midnight** covers early Friday, including the previous Thursday's service tail; it is not a completed Friday-night/Saturday study. The Central line **Morning Flow** composition compares typical demand across seven stations and twelve directed links in 96 quarter-hour intervals; it does not assign loads to individual trains.

The three-line Victoria/Jubilee/Elizabeth prediction collector and two-hour replay compiler are implemented. Collector health and a complete observed weekday were not verified in this reconciliation. Aviation remains a separately evidenced observation layer. Each source keeps its date: putting these layers on one clock does not make May cycling, autumn demand, historical roads and September schedules contemporaneous.

Implementation records: [combined boards](https://github.com/emmettl/allchange/blob/da94953/docs/COMBINED-STATION-BOARDS.md), [passenger demand](https://github.com/emmettl/allchange/blob/da94953/docs/PASSENGER-DEMAND.md), [Morning Flow](https://github.com/emmettl/allchange/blob/da94953/docs/MORNING-FLOW.md), [cycle hire](https://github.com/emmettl/allchange/blob/da94953/docs/CYCLE-HIRE.md) and [After Midnight](https://github.com/emmettl/allchange/blob/da94953/docs/AFTER-MIDNIGHT.md). The [national-study inventory](NATIONAL-DATA-FEASIBILITY.md#all-change-inventory--local-inspection-13-september-2026) records measured artifact volumes and the sharing plan.

## Thesis: two simultaneous Londons

The edition is not merely transport moving around London. Its subject is the gap between two equally real conceptions of the city:

- the **physical city** of crooked tracks, uneven distances, tunnels, the Thames and actual geography; and
- the **mental city** of Beck-space, where station order and interchange matter while distance politely lies.

Every train remains the same journey while the city changes underneath it. A service approaching King's Cross does not cut, restart or become a diagrammatic substitute: miles collapse around its unchanged route progress until the crooked physical railway resolves into a legible connection.

This makes the title operate on three levels: interchange, movement and the map literally changing its conception of space. The transformation is therefore not an optional display convenience; it is All Change's defining authored study.

## First study

Start with one ordinary weekday from 06:45–08:45 and keep the first payload rail-led:

- London Underground, Elizabeth line, London Overground, DLR and Tramlink;
- Greater London boundary and the Thames as the dominant geographic anchors;
- real line geometry, station labels, service search, route isolation and follow cameras;
- the shared cyan motion grammar, with restrained official line colours used for selection rather than turning the whole scene into a conventional Tube map; and
- deterministic timetable interpolation with explicit provenance.

The first authored moment should show trains converging across central London while orbital and outer branches remain legible. A Thames-crossing follow view would provide the edition's first unmistakably London-specific composition.

## Geography ↔ diagram

London should be legible in two coordinate systems. **GEOGRAPHY** shows the physical city: real track geometry, distances, the Greater London boundary and the Thames. **DIAGRAM** is an independently authored, Beck-inspired topological composition: station order, interchange and line relationships take precedence over distance and bearing. It must evoke London's diagrammatic tradition without reproducing TfL's current map artwork.

The switch is a continuous transformation, not a scene change. The clock, active vehicles, search result, selected service or station, label policy and playback state must survive it. Water and boundary geography recede as the diagram becomes dominant; interchange structure and restrained line identity become clearer. The Thames may remain as a simplified orienting stroke because it is meaningful in both Londons.

An optional **limited chrome** presentation mode leaves only the visualization and its timeline visible. It is implemented as an application view rather than depending on browser fullscreen support, so it behaves consistently on iPhone as well as desktop. The timeline retains an explicit exit button; `F` toggles the mode and Escape restores the complete interface without clearing the current selection.

The transition should be theatrical but intelligible. Terrain flattens, the Thames simplifies, stations settle onto an octilinear grid, curves resolve into horizontal, vertical and 45-degree runs, and labels rotate into their diagram positions. The camera moves from geographic perspective toward a near-orthographic diagram view. Each gesture must explain the changing spatial model; spectacle follows from that explanation rather than covering it.

### Runtime model

- Physical longitude/latitude remains the canonical source coordinate and is never overwritten.
- A separately loaded layout artifact maps stable stop or interchange IDs to authored diagram coordinates and supplies diagram paths for route branches. Platform children collapse onto their interchange node unless an authored study explicitly needs them.
- Every moving service retains one canonical timetable/path progress. At a transition value `t`, the renderer samples the physical and diagram paths independently at that progress, then interpolates the two resulting positions. It must not interpolate raw path vertices: geographic and diagram paths have different vertex counts and meanings.
- Static edges may be compiled into corresponding station-to-station spans with a shared normalized sample count, allowing the whole network to bend continuously without changing topology.
- Selected stations and followed vehicles remain anchored near their pre-transition screen position. The camera interpolates between physical and diagram framing rather than resetting to a second home view.
- Label anchors move with their nodes, but the accepted label set is frozen during the transformation and collision placement is recomputed once it settles. This prevents the map from sparkling as labels cross.

### Authoring and validation

The diagram layout should be generated offline and committed as a small deterministic artifact. An octilinear constraint solver may provide the first arrangement, but the finished result is an authored composition with explicit overrides for central interchanges, branches and the Thames. The compiler must verify that station order, branch membership, termini and interchange identity are identical in both layouts, while permitting only declared visual crossings.

The complete diagram artifact now provides that mechanical baseline. `npm run data:london:diagram` applies a central-London lens before snapping paths to horizontal, vertical and 45-degree segments. The lens enlarges the dense interchange field, compresses long outer branches, coalesces source IDs that describe the same named interchange and routes both travel directions through the same bend. Placement is collision-free for unrelated stations and scores candidate cells for direct alignment with already placed neighbours; 95% of its 1,119 paths are now a single octilinear run rather than a gratuitous elbow. All 508 source-identified stops and path indexes remain stable through the morph. The resulting artifact is 49.2 KiB raw and 8.9 KiB compressed, including its separately authored Thames stroke. Its source-network and authored-override hashes, stop coverage, identity uniqueness, collision freedom, path coverage, Thames presence and octilinear geometry are enforced by the London build gate. `fixtures/tfl/all-change-diagram-overrides.json` remains the separate visual-editing seam: principal interchange cells, selected path bends and contextual strokes can be curated there without modifying the timetable artifact or runtime.

As the diagram resolves, the generic cyan traffic field and its pale frequency chords disappear completely. An edition-owned line-identity layer takes over with flat cased route ribbons, separated shared trunks, fixed-screen stop dots, interchange rings and clean Helvetica labels. It uses TfL's current screen palette as a source, with only the darkest colours lifted for legibility in the Motion Studies night field; geography remains in the shared modal palette. This keeps the diagram recognisably London without presenting a reproduction of TfL's map artwork or making the physical view resemble a journey planner.

The first **PULSE** study reuses the shared clock-face engine around four deliberately contrasting interchanges: King's Cross St. Pancras, Bank, Waterloo and Stratford. Calls are derived from the same currently loaded timetable slice, so changing the main clock, playback speed or service-category emphasis also changes the orbit. The interchange can be changed from a compact status-card selector, `P` toggles the study, and selecting a geographic search result returns to the network without losing time.

The first prototype should cover the complete rail-led morning lattice rather than a single showcase line; the value of the transformation is seeing the entire city's physical irregularity resolve into logical structure. Acceptance criteria are:

- no vehicle jump, route reassignment or clock discontinuity during the morph;
- the current selection remains visible and understandable throughout;
- deterministic geometry and label results for recording and scrubbing;
- a reversible keyboard- and touch-accessible **GEOGRAPHY / DIAGRAM** control;
- a reduced-motion path that changes layout without a sweeping animation; and
- mobile frame time and artifact size included in the London-specific performance gates. The local iPhone browser matrix requires at least 18 animation frames in 1.8 seconds with a 95th-percentile interval below 125 ms. Hosted CI uses a 12-frame / 175 ms liveness floor because its headless WebKit software renderer is not a physical-device benchmark.

## Adapter proofs

The first compiled fixtures are deliberately smaller than the complete opening lattice. They exercise the shared network contract without entering Gleislicht's Swiss payload or edition selector:

- Bakerloo: 39 weekday journeys from Elephant & Castle across 25 NaPTAN stations;
- Northern: 84 journeys from Morden across short turns and the Bank/Charing Cross branch structures;
- DLR: 51 journeys from Bank split correctly toward Lewisham and Woolwich Arsenal;
- Tramlink: 17 journeys from Beckenham Junction, using TfL's alternate `Monday to Friday` schedule spelling;
- Lioness: bounded complete studies in both directions; and
- the PDF lattice: 321 morning journeys across every named Overground line and 16 active Elizabeth branch families.

The compiler now collapses TfL's repeated arrival/dwell interval records into one stop call with distinct arrival and departure times. Each interval pattern is matched to the ordered NaPTAN IDs for its own route branch before the official line string is split. Shared segments are reused, while genuinely different branches retain different geometry.

Run `npm run data:london:proofs` to refresh the bounded adapter proofs, or use the individual proof scripts for one request. `TFL_API_KEY` is supported for route-sequence access and should be used for repeated requests, in line with TfL's developer guidance. The generated metadata records retrieval time, source hashes, source endpoints, TfL's data-service terms, the selected weekday schedule and the fact that these are not realtime or complete London service-day claims.

### Observed operations collector

`motionstudies-london-operations` is the bounded first operational study. Its configured once-per-minute collection requests the complete arrival-prediction sets for the Victoria, Jubilee and Elizabeth lines plus their current status, groups predictions by TfL vehicle identity and writes both a compact latest snapshot and an immutable gzip observation to the existing private R2 bucket. The observation model retains predicted stop calls rather than inventing GPS coordinates. The implemented R2 export and two-hour compiler join observations to static route geometry for an explicitly prediction-derived replay; implementation alone does not establish current collector health or a complete archived day.

The three-line collector uses four TfL requests per minute. It works within the anonymous allowance for initial verification, while `TFL_API_KEY` should be installed as the Worker secret for sustained recording. See [CLOUDFLARE.md](https://github.com/emmettl/allchange/blob/main/docs/CLOUDFLARE.md).

The first browser slice exposes a compact **PLAN / OBSERVED** control. OBSERVED adopts the current London clock, loads the matching static day topology and projects each TfL vehicle only when its ordered predicted stops match a known route pattern. Ringed lights distinguish operational observations from the planned lattice; unmatched vehicles remain counted in the status card instead of being forced onto a plausible-looking line. The timeline and tempo controls rest while the latest snapshot refreshes every 30 seconds.

After a civil day has accumulated, `npm run data:london:operations:export -- --date=YYYY-MM-DD` downloads the adjacent UTC R2 partitions into the ignored owner-only recording directory. `npm run data:london:operations:compile -- --date=YYYY-MM-DD` then requires at least 1,200 unique minutes by default and emits integrity-hashed two-hour chunks plus a small day manifest. Gaps remain explicit; the compiler never manufactures missing observations.

`npm run data:london:catalogue` separately discovers every currently advertised line in the five rail-led modes. Its compact committed catalogue preserves 20 line identities and 125 directional branch definitions, each with ordered NaPTAN stops and a geometry hash. Three NaPTAN hierarchy samples retain interchange, entrance and platform children without inventing absent platform names.

TfL documents that its Journey Planner timetable feed covers Underground, bus, DLR, tram, cable car and river—not Elizabeth line or London Overground. Both rail modes do have current official public timetable PDFs. A separate grid extractor records each PDF hash and validity period, then accepts only columns with both requested endpoints, monotonic times and calls in official route order. Limited-stop columns are explicit: their path geometry spans the omitted non-calling stations rather than fabricating calls. It also understands repeated grids, side-by-side tables and TfL's weekday heading variants. Regenerating the lattice requires Poppler's `pdftotext`; the compiled JSON remains dependency-free.

`npm run data:london:lattice:unified` remains the bounded morning proof. The full-day equivalent compiles 8,797 movements, 353 source-identified stops and 1,008 real path segments across 13 lines and 26 directions. Limited-stop trains use the complete branch geometry between calls; TfL's overlapping DLR terminal responses are retained only where their stop pattern matches the selected route. Three Metropolitan origins advertised in topology exposed no suitable weekday schedule at retrieval and remain explicitly listed as inactive instead of disappearing.

The PDF day compiler derives 43 branch-audit tasks from the catalogue and accepts 39 active full-day branch patterns across every named Overground line and the Elizabeth family. Two Elizabeth and two Windrush topology branches have no auditable through column and remain in `metadata.coverage.inactiveBranches`. `npm run data:london:day` acquires both source families and combines them into a 10,455-movement, 505-stop, five-mode contract. It assigns 462 stable station-name ranks, derives the 1,708-movement opening window from exactly the same topology, and writes twelve two-hour chunks. Stops and paths are therefore index-identical between the morning, full day and diagram; changing the clock never changes a journey's spatial identity.

The topology manifest is 30.9 KiB compressed and the largest movement chunk is 169.7 KiB compressed. Chunk byte length and SHA-256 are checked before adoption, adjacent chunks are prefetched only after the current one is usable, and the complete 1.38 MiB day never enters the opening request graph. Build-time staging copies the opening lattice, geography, diagram and progressive day artifacts into ignored public files for All Change’s root `index.html`; Gleislicht never requests them and Git retains one canonical copy.

## AIR — observed London

The optional **AIR** study replays observed ADS-B/MLAT positions over Greater London on the same Friday and clock as the railway. It is deliberately atmospheric rather than infrastructural: small magenta needles occupy compressed real altitude, leave only a three-minute afterimage and never create a permanent air-route network. Rail stays brighter and denser.

The opening 06:45–08:45 BST artifact contains 374 filtered flight tracks and 15,741 position samples. Its 582 KiB JSON is 199 KiB compressed and is fetched only after AIR is enabled, leaving the rail-led opening payload unchanged. Selecting AIR again in the transport legend applies the normal category emphasis: rail infrastructure, trains and their labels recede while observed flights remain legible.

The 24-hour study indexes 3,182 flight segments and 137,886 samples. A 64 KiB compressed manifest supports callsign and six-character ICAO-address search across the whole day; 24 overlapping one-hour motion files are loaded progressively around the shared railway clock. The busiest file is 132 KiB compressed and the complete air day is about 1.92 MiB compressed, but is never parsed as one browser payload.

Selecting a search result or aircraft needle moves the clock into its observed interval, enters the shared damped follow camera and exposes callsign, ICAO address, altitude, groundspeed and derived heading. Aircraft and trains share the same context-sensitive label control. Heathrow (`LHR` / `EGLL`), London City (`LCY` / `EGLC`) and Gatwick (`LGW` / `EGKK`) are also first-class search results. Selecting one restores geographic space, frames its location, isolates AIR and retains emphasis on the observed tracks which enter its low-altitude approach envelope; unrelated aircraft, rail labels and surface movement recede.

Airport association is deliberately observational rather than scheduled. A track is associated when its recorded samples enter the airport's explicit low-altitude approach envelope, and the resulting identifier is baked into the morning artifact, every progressive day chunk and the day manifest. This preserves the association after an aircraft climbs away while avoiding a false claim that callsign alone reveals origin or destination. The current artifacts identify 144 Heathrow, 46 London City and 27 Gatwick tracks in the morning study, and 1,343, 385 and 153 respectively across the complete day.

The source is the ADSB.lol historical heatmap release for 4 September 2026, cropped to `-0.75,51.2,0.4,51.75` and interpreted at BST (`UTC+1`). The same ground, stale-position and slow/light-aircraft filters as LUFTRAUM are applied offline. Published artifacts preserve ADSB.lol provenance and the ODbL 1.0 licence; raw receiver slices never ship to the browser.

## ROAD — London Orbital

The optional **ROAD** study reconstructs traffic on the M1, M3, M4, M11, M23, M25 and M40 from National Highways WebTRIS observations. It does not represent tracked automobiles. Each warm light particle is a deterministic visual sample of the measured directional flow, while particle speed and the heavier amber stream follow the detector's mean speed and vehicle-length classes. Selecting ROAD applies the same highlight/dim convention as a rail category; searching a motorway isolates its corridor and frames it geographically.

The retained full-day artifact records Friday 5 September 2025. The corrected audit accepts 232 reporting sites from 304 candidates and excludes 7,470 incomplete records; it does not establish complete observations at all 304 sites. Missing intervals remain gaps. This historical date stays visible so the composition never implies that road and rail are contemporaneous observations.

Topology, a manifest and four six-hour motion chunks are fetched only after ROAD is enabled. The original milestone measured about 222 KiB compressed, with a largest motion chunk of about 43 KiB; those are historical measurements, not a fresh benchmark of the corrected artifact. `npm run data:london:roads` rebuilds from the official site inventory and daily-report API. The methodology remains explicit: **traffic-flow reconstruction / no vehicle tracking**.

## SURFACE — Thames crossings

The optional **SURFACE** study adds the three currently advertised scheduled River Bus lines—RB1, RB4 and RB6—and London Cable Car in both directions. It is a physical-map layer, so enabling it enters the 24-hour Friday study and keeps the current clock while diagram mode rests. RB4 and RB6 are already visible during the morning opening; RB1 and the cable car begin later according to the published timetable.

The 492-journey artifact contains 26 source-identified stops and 77 route-path segments, and is about 21 KiB compressed. It stays outside the opening request graph. River and cable movements retain separate `ferry` and `cableway` categories, remain searchable by route or stop, and can be isolated through the same legend policy as rail. `npm run data:london:surface` rebuilds the file from TfL route sequences and Journey Planner timetables; the compiler records source hashes and states that positions are scheduled interpolation rather than observed craft or cabin telemetry.

## BUS — original street current 001

The following records the first corridor milestone. The current full-catalogue scope is documented above; these counts and payloads apply only to that earlier proof.

The first bus study is deliberately a corridor rather than London's entire bus network. Route 26 crosses central London from Victoria to Hackney Wick through Fleet Street, St Paul's, Bank and Liverpool Street; N26 extends the same visual argument north-east to Walthamstow and Chingford. It is a useful street-level counterpoint to the railway because its path repeatedly touches major interchanges while remaining visibly shaped by roads.

The study contains 230 scheduled journeys, 169 source-identified stops and 170 TfL route-path segments across a complete civil Friday. Early-Friday N26 departures are compiled from TfL's `Mo-Th Nights/Tu-Fr Morning` schedule and shifted from its post-24:00 notation onto the shared 00:00–24:00 clock. Positions are timetable interpolation, not observed bus telemetry.

BUS is a separately enabled physical-map layer. It enters the 24-hour study, frames the corridor, exposes route 26/N26 and their stops to the shared search and selection system, and uses the shared bus marker rather than pretending to track individual vehicles. The manifest and twelve two-hour motion chunks total about 84 KiB compressed; the opening request graph remains unchanged and adjacent chunks load only after the current one is ready. `npm run data:london:bus` rebuilds the source-audited study from TfL's Unified API.

## Data strategy

Transport for London's Unified API is the primary adapter target. TfL describes it as a common multimodal model and exposes timetables, arrivals, routes, lines, topology and geographic data. API access should remain in offline tooling or a small credential-holding edge adapter; compact studies stay static and deterministic in the browser.

The initial geographic shell is now compiled directly from the Greater London Authority's official web-map context service. Its dedicated London GLA boundary and River Thames polygon layers are transformed to WGS84, rounded and simplified at a 35-metre tolerance. `npm run data:london:geography` reduces 10,921 boundary and 6,191 Thames source vertices to 803 and 256 respectively, producing a 24 KiB source-hashed artifact without relying on a runtime basemap.

TfL attribution and branding rules are part of the edition contract: the project must not imply that All Change is an official TfL application, and each artifact must retain its source and licence metadata.

## Exit criterion

All Change must feel like another work made with the same instrument—not Gleislicht with different filenames, and not a generic dark-mode transport dashboard. Its signature image is a living London changing between physical and mental space without interrupting a single journey.
