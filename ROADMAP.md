# Roadmap

[Project goals](docs/VISION.md) · [Study index](docs/README.md) · [Catalogue programme](docs/CATALOGUE.md)

## Repository milestone — 7 September 2026

- [x] Move shared packages, the widget lab and catalogue into Motion Studies.
- [x] Publish all four coordinated npm packages and verify trusted publishing.
- [x] Move each edition into its own repository with exact package pins and independent checks.
- [x] Publish Gleislicht, All Change and Correspondances on their own Pages sites; retain the private Local / Express proof and its publication hold.
- [x] Centralise city briefs, programme goals and this roadmap in Motion Studies.

The stages below retain the delivery history from the first Swiss study through the wider catalogue. Future work follows the source and publication gates in each brief; no calendar dates are implied.

This is an iterative art-and-data project. Each stage should end in a coherent visual study rather than a long period of invisible infrastructure work.

## 0 — Motion language (now)

- [x] Establish the Vite, React, TypeScript, Three.js, oxlint and Vitest baseline.
- [x] Create a full-screen follow-camera prototype with procedural wireframe terrain.
- [x] Separate journey/timetable concepts from Three.js rendering.
- [x] Label synthetic data and add pause, scrub and camera controls.
- [x] Tune camera damping, scale, colour and fog across representative phone, tablet and desktop sizes.
- [x] Set and enforce the first mobile transfer budget; establish frame-time telemetry with the terrain work.

**Exit:** the prototype communicates “night train through luminous Swiss topography” in its first few seconds.

## 1 — Scheduled Switzerland

- [x] Add a repeatable, streaming ingestion script for the current Swiss GTFS Static archive.
- [x] Parse rail routes, trips, stop times, stops and service calendars offline.
- [x] Resolve service-day rules, exceptions, after-midnight times and source/version metadata.
- [x] Produce a compact morning artifact instead of shipping the 232 MB GTFS ZIP.
- [x] Render the Friday morning window in a national view with a deterministic simulation clock.
- [x] Frame the network with a simplified, luminous swissBOUNDARIES3D national outline.
- [x] Ground the network with simplified federal lake polygons and luminous shorelines.
- [x] Replace straight stop-to-stop segments with matched Federal Office of Transport rail geometry; retain explicit fallbacks where the join cannot be made.
- [x] Add a compact full-day artifact for the four hub pulse studies.
- [x] Add a separately loaded full service-day national study while preserving the fast morning load.

**Exit:** thousands of scheduled movements form a recognisable, scrubbable national rail network.

## 2 — Regional and urban pulse

- [x] Generalise GTFS preprocessing across Swiss rail, tram, bus, ferry, cableway, funicular and metro route types.
- [x] Produce a separately loaded Zürich city morning artifact and scale switcher.
- [x] Keep the national page load rail-only and derive the city study on demand.
- [x] Join the official ZVV/VBZ GTFS shapes after validating line, stop and date alignment.
- [x] Add a ZVV overview with zoom-dependent aggregation and regional map hierarchy.
- [x] Add a Genève/TPG study with French labels and carefully handled cross-border services.
- [x] Select Kiental–Griesalp route 220 from measured schedule and terrain criteria.
- [x] Build a synchronized, progressively loaded 24-hour rural PostBus versus Zürich tram contrast mode.

**Exit:** regional connections and urban density read clearly at their own scales, and the rural–urban contrast is compelling without falsifying frequency or position.

See [docs/REGIONAL-STUDIES.md](https://github.com/emmettl/gleislicht/blob/main/docs/REGIONAL-STUDIES.md) for the study and packaging model.
The measured corridor decision is recorded in [docs/POSTBUS-CORRIDOR.md](https://github.com/emmettl/gleislicht/blob/main/docs/POSTBUS-CORRIDOR.md).

## 3 — Real terrain, real corridors

- [x] Establish LV95/WGS84/WebGL coordinate transforms and a single distance model.
- [x] Build an offline swissALTIRegio processing path: crop, resample, quantise and package on demand.
- [x] Create desktop and mobile terrain LODs around the matched Zürich–Chur rail shape.
- [x] Add terrain-integrated lake surfaces and station beacons to the first measured corridor.
- [x] Add a higher-resolution swissALTI3D Alpine corridor crop for Kiental–Griesalp, with road-following route geometry.
- [x] Add tunnel-aware line treatment to the Zürich–Chur rail corridor from SBB infrastructure records.
- [x] Show mandatory `© swisstopo` attribution wherever derived terrain appears.

**Exit:** Zürich–Chur and one Alpine corridor run over recognisable real terrain on laptop and mobile GPUs.

## 4 — Realtime without pretending

- [x] Build a small server-side poller contract with the required API key, redirects, user-agent, 30-second edge cache and restrictive CORS.
- [x] Decode binary protobuf and refuse to combine updates with a different GTFS Static release or service day.
- [x] Apply delays, cancellations and exactly matched skipped stops to scheduled animation.
- [x] Visually distinguish scheduled and realtime-adjusted interpolation, including delayed-train rings and label offsets.
- [x] Surface loading, feed mismatch, stale and offline fallbacks in a compact operations control.
- [x] Ship an explicitly labelled deterministic demo so the complete interaction can be reviewed without credentials.
- [ ] Provision the poller secret and URL, then regenerate current-day static artifacts before enabling LIVE by default.
- [ ] Add service-alert presentation after the Trip Updates path has run reliably in production.

The national GTFS-RT feed supplies trip updates and alerts, not vehicle positions. Unless another properly licensed position source is added, “live” means timetable motion corrected by realtime predictions—not GPS dots.

**Exit:** the current service day changes credibly when operations change, with provenance visible on demand.

See [docs/REALTIME.md](https://github.com/emmettl/gleislicht/blob/main/docs/REALTIME.md) for the trust model, deployment contract and activation checklist.

## 5 — The visual instrument

- [x] Add the first national → selected-train camera descent and route highlight.
- [x] Search and select by train number, service, origin or destination.
- [x] Colour-code motion by service class while preserving night-view legibility.
- [x] Reveal collision-aware station labels progressively with map zoom.
- [x] Add context-aware, switchable labels for moving trains.
- [x] Add a hub-scale Takt pulse for Zürich HB, Bern, Basel SBB and Genève.
- [x] Loop the hub orbit across a full day with four authored playback tempos.
- [x] Add an alternate station-flow view with scheduled GTFS platform assignments.
- [x] Replace the first supported map-level selected-train follow with a terrain-backed corridor transition.
- [x] Add a first-class selector for switching directly between the authored terrain journeys.
- [x] Add time-of-day presets, speed control and a short looping “director mode.”
- [x] Add authored palettes and camera behaviours for plateau, lake and Alpine routes.
- [x] Add three opt-in Driftbox cues with adaptive crossfades between network, hub and journey modes.
- [x] Extend the score with spatial details derived from speed, tunnel state and terrain—never autoplayed.

**Exit:** viewers can explore deliberately or let Gleislicht compose a journey for them.

## 6 — Publish and sustain

- [x] Add reviewed, automated national source refreshes with validation and atomic artifact versions.
- [x] Add regression fixtures for DST changes, midnight rollover and missing shapes; reject mismatched national artifact sets.
- [x] Add opt-in local performance telemetry without personal tracking.
- [x] Add an accessible non-WebGL fallback.
- [x] Publish a source, attribution and methodology page.
- [x] Add a user-initiated recording/export workflow for shareable visual studies.
- [x] Publish the reviewed static build through GitHub Pages; private previews remain non-canonical.

## 7 — LUFTRAUM

- [x] Add a named, optional air study without turning the railway atlas into a generic transport map.
- [x] Prepare one matching historical hour of observed ADS-B positions as a compact static artifact.
- [x] Filter ground traffic, stale tracks and slow low-level light-aircraft noise in preprocessing.
- [x] Replay aircraft deterministically on the shared clock with compressed real altitude.
- [x] Render aircraft as restrained magenta needles with short, ephemeral trails—never a permanent air network.
- [x] Lazy-load the complete study only after the visitor selects **LUFT**.
- [x] Make aircraft selectable and expose callsign, altitude, groundspeed, heading and a tilted follow camera.
- [ ] Judge the visual experiment on real phones before considering a longer window, richer filtering or live polling.

**Exit:** the observed sky reads as a sparse atmospheric stratum above the deliberately built rail lattice, while the opening national study remains railway-first and unchanged in payload.

See [docs/LUFTRAUM.md](https://github.com/emmettl/gleislicht/blob/main/docs/LUFTRAUM.md) for the data contract, filtering and visual grammar.

## 8 — AUTO

- [x] Define road movement as aggregate reconstruction rather than individual vehicle tracking.
- [x] Anchor Road Study 001 to current ASTRA detector sites along the A1 through Zürich.
- [x] Add a deterministic two-hour calibration artifact without increasing the opening payload.
- [x] Reconstruct separate light- and heavy-vehicle streams from flow, speed and corridor length.
- [x] Render warm-white and amber traffic beneath the cyan rail and magenta air layers.
- [x] Make AUTO an optional, isolatable service category with multilingual provenance.
- [x] Add a credential-safe, filtered one-minute ASTRA recorder and a completeness-gated compiler.
- [x] Audit all federal counters against official national-road axes and render the lazy national skeleton.
- [x] Resolve 49 of 59 ambiguous directional matches from neighbouring-counter continuity.
- [x] Build 609 measurement-ready directional sections and searchable A-road corridor focus.
- [x] Resolve the final 10 interchange directions from FEDRO TMC point-to-road identifiers rather than proximity.
- [x] Add a progressive national minute-study compiler, loader and section-flow renderer ready for recorded snapshots.
- [ ] Begin authenticated one-minute snapshot recording and replace calibration values with a complete measured hour.
- [ ] Judge the A1 composition on real phones before adding A2 Gotthard or a recorded full day.

**Exit:** the three layers remain visually and methodologically distinct: scheduled rail journeys, observed aircraft trajectories and synthetic traffic reconstructed from aggregate measurement.

See [docs/AUTO.md](https://github.com/emmettl/gleislicht/blob/main/docs/AUTO.md) for the data contract, reconstruction and recording path.

## 9 — Motion Studies / All Change

- [x] Separate the visual language and CSS tokens from transport-domain types.
- [x] Define a typed edition contract for identity, time, theme and lazy data assets.
- [x] Move the complete Switzerland asset catalogue behind that contract.
- [x] Generalise boundary and water types without changing existing artifacts.
- [x] Define the first London study, source strategy and staged delivery plan.
- [x] Establish Motion Studies as the catalogue identity: 005 Gleislicht / Switzerland and 006 All Change / London.
- [x] Build the TfL adapter proof from a bounded weekday Bakerloo fixture with NaPTAN stops, route geometry and station intervals.
- [x] Compile the London morning lattice with Greater London and Thames geometry.
- [x] Add a dedicated London entry point once the fixture passes source and payload validation.
- [x] Add a limited-chrome London presentation mode that leaves the timeline available on desktop and iPhone.
- [x] Add an edition-neutral alternate-layout contract and a lazy, deterministic Beck-inspired diagram artifact.
- [x] Animate continuously between London's geographic and diagram spaces without resetting journeys or selection.
- [x] Reshape the logical layout around central-London expansion, compressed outer branches, shared interchange cells and stable two-way bends.
- [x] Add authored interchange/path overrides, a simplified Thames and an optional TfL-echoing line palette to complete the iconic-map composition.
- [x] Make the resolved London diagram read as a line map: collision-free station cells, predominantly direct octilinear runs, cased route ribbons, stop dots and interchange rings, with the aggregate traffic field fully receded.
- [x] Enforce the future package/repository boundary in CI so shared runtime code remains place-neutral.
- [x] Add a separately loaded, integrity-checked 24-hour London timetable in progressive two-hour chunks.
- [x] Add an optional observed-aircraft layer for London with matching two-hour and progressively loaded 24-hour studies, searchable flight codes, airport approach/departure selection and category emphasis.
- [x] Add an optional National Highways motorway study with real detector geometry, recorded flow/speed, progressive 24-hour loading, ROAD isolation and searchable corridor focus.
- [x] Add the first London-specific interchange pulse study across four contrasting hubs.
- [x] Add a separately loaded 24-hour London surface study for scheduled River Bus and cable-car movement.
- [x] Prove surface buses as a separate progressive corridor study with route 26/N26, shared-clock search and category isolation.

**Exit:** Gleislicht and All Change are independently authored Motion Studies, sharing runtime behaviour and visual grammar without sharing titles or place-specific assumptions.

See [docs/EDITIONS.md](./docs/EDITIONS.md) for the reusable boundary and [docs/LONDON.md](./docs/LONDON.md) for the second-edition plan.

## 10 — Catalogue programme

- [x] Fix the first four-work catalogue: 005 Gleislicht, 006 All Change, 007 Local / Express and 008 Correspondances.
- [x] Give New York and Paris distinct visual theses, signature studies and edition-level exit criteria.
- [x] Define admission criteria that prevent Motion Studies becoming one renderer with interchangeable bounding boxes.
- [x] Finish All Change's authored diagram overrides, interchange pulse studies and mobile frame-time gate.
- [x] Audit licensing, service-day semantics, identifiers, geometry and historical reproducibility for New York and Paris before ingesting complete feeds; keep New York unpublished while its application terms remain unresolved.
- [x] Prove one bounded New York local/express corridor through the current edition contract.
- [x] Turn that proof into an independent Local / Express entry point with Manhattan shoreline context, a lazy directional diagram, pattern isolation, search and a scheduled-overtake director.
- [x] Make the overtake director isolate both journeys, preserve local/express route identity and frame the completed order reversal.
- [x] Add an integrity-checked authored diagram layer for station rhythm, direction gaps, bends and schematic rivers.
- [x] Complete the 007 publication review and keep its page/data out of Pages until MTA clarifies transformation and application licensing.
- [x] Compile the bounded 007 service day into twelve lazy two-hour chunks while preserving the fast opening study.
- [x] Enforce a 390 KiB compressed first-view budget and desktop/iPhone browser gates for the New York foundation.
- [x] Use the third viable edition as the extraction trigger for private `@motionstudies/core`, `@motionstudies/three` and `@motionstudies/web` workspaces with real package imports.
- [x] Split shared packages and edition shells into repositories; publish coordinated npm releases after validating their public contracts and packed consumers.
- [ ] Hold further 007 Local / Express expansion and public release at the MTA licensing gate; retain its bounded proof as technical evidence.
- [x] Build 008 Correspondances through a Métro/RER opening study, a continuous centre–periphery scale study and three source-backed interchange compositions.
- [x] Give Correspondances an independent source-pinned shell, exact transfer evidence, official Seine/city context and a lazy 24-hour two-line study within a phone-first payload gate.
- [x] Begin the source and feasibility audit for **NORIKAE — A Tokyo motion study**: separate the durable Toei proof, conditional Tokyo Metro path and Challenge 2026-only Yamanote/private-railway coverage.
- [ ] Resolve the ODPT browser-artifact and historical-refresh terms, then compile a rights-clean Toei 07:00–09:00 loop-and-crossings proof before attempting the complete operator lattice.
- [x] Begin San Francisco's source and feasibility audit: separate 511's strong historical/observed technical path from the unresolved 511/SFMTA public-artifact terms, and keep the title open until the vertical signature study is proven.
- [ ] Resolve 511 browser-artifact, historical-use and sublicensing terms with MTC and SFMTA, then compile a bounded 08:00–10:00 hills-to-Bay proof over DataSF terrain.
- [x] Begin Hong Kong's source and feasibility audit: separate exact ferry schedules, reconstructed surface headways, live MTR station forecasts and measured 3D station structure instead of presenting them as one kind of motion evidence.
- [ ] Compile a bounded 18:00–20:00 Victoria Harbour proof with exact Star Ferry departures, labelled headway-generated trams and structural-only MTR; keep the rail-led edition gated on an authoritative timetable or trajectory source.
- [x] Capture the wider city-thesis pipeline—without implying feasibility—for Istanbul, Mumbai, Venice, Amsterdam, Chicago, Singapore, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Sydney and Lisbon alongside the existing Tokyo, Hong Kong, Berlin and San Francisco candidates.
- [x] Complete source, rights, motion-semantics, geography and bounded-proof feasibility studies for all ten wider city candidates.
- [x] Complete Berlin's feasibility audit: verify VBB's current/archived schedule and realtime paths, distinguish replacement buses from same-named Ringbahn rail records, and isolate the remaining vertical-structure work.
- [ ] Advance Venice, Sydney and Berlin to source-pinned proof acquisition; retain Singapore, Lisbon, Amsterdam and Chicago behind their stated access, coverage or publication gates.
- [ ] Do not prototype Mumbai or Johannesburg until the missing authoritative movement evidence and, for Johannesburg, locally governed representation process exist.
- [x] Audit **MANIFEST — World trade in motion**: distinguish observed AIS movement from self-reported vessel data, inferred port-to-port voyages and aggregate commodity evidence; gate global individual tracks on written derived-publication rights.
- [ ] Prototype MANIFEST's global cargo/tanker field with non-commercial hourly vessel presence, compare identical commercial AIS evaluation slices at China/Gulf/choke-point coverage, and compile one rights-clean regional track proof before procurement.
- [ ] Keep every second-wave city and MANIFEST unnumbered until each has passed the catalogue admission test.

**Exit:** every announced edition has a local argument, a defensible source model, an authored signature image and an independent payload budget; shared packages exist because three real works proved the seam.

## Early technical decisions

- Preprocess large source datasets in Node; serve small versioned binary/JSON assets to the client.
- Keep schedule/realtime/topography adapters independent of the renderer.
- Treat source timestamps, coordinate reference systems and attribution as data, not prose added at the end.
- Prefer a few measured levels of detail over runtime-heavy general GIS machinery.
- Keep the visual client statically deployable; add a minimal server component only for secrets and realtime polling.
